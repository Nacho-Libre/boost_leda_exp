[[kruskal_msp](https://github.com/Nacho-Libre/kruskal_strong_comp/tree/master/kruskal_mst)] presents a simple implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm for finding minnimum spanning trees on connected undirected graphs. There are also two helper functions for transforming Boost Graphs to Leda Graphs and vice versa.<br>Implented using Boost & Leda Library


[[str_comp](https://github.com/Nacho-Libre/kruskal_strong_comp/tree/master/str_comp)] presents the implementation of an algorithm for finding strong components on a directed graph and a checker function that verifies it's correctness. <br>Implemented using Leda Library.
