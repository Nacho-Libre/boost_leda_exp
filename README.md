## Advanced Algorithms Implementations

### Requirements
In order to run the test you are going to need a version of <b>C++</b> installed and also the libraries <b>BOOST</b> and <b>LEDA</b>

### Content of this repository

* [[kruskal_mst](https://github.com/Nacho-Libre/kruskal_strong_comp/tree/master/kruskal_mst)] presents a simple implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm for finding minnimum spanning trees on connected undirected graphs. There are also two helper functions for transforming Boost Graphs to Leda Graphs and vice versa.<br>Implented using Boost & Leda Library


* [[str_comp](https://github.com/Nacho-Libre/kruskal_strong_comp/tree/master/str_comp)] presents the implementation of an algorithm for finding strong components on a directed graph and a checker function that verifies it's correctness. <br>Implemented using Leda Library.
