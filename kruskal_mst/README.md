Advanced Algorithms Implementations<br> using Boost and Leda Data types and functions.
----
This repository consists of two branches that are completely different, That's because at first I though that the two of them will have a lot of code in common. I should probably separate them in different repos sometime.

Content of the repository
--
[[kruskal_msp](https://github.com/Nacho-Libre/kruskal_strong_comp/tree/kruskal_mst)] branch presents a simple implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm for finding minnimum spanning trees on connected undirected graphs. There are also two helper functions for transforming Boost Graphs to Leda Graphs and vice versa.<br>Implented using Boost & Leda Library


[[str_comp](https://github.com/Nacho-Libre/kruskal_strong_comp/tree/str_comp)] branch presents the implementation of an algorithm for finding strong components on a directed graph and a checker function that verifies it's correctness. <br>Implemented using Leda Library.
